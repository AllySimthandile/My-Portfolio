Let's start with a simple example in R, where we predict women's weight from their
height. If we were articulating this question per Microsoft's Team Data Science
Process, we would be stating this as a business question during the business
understanding phase. How can we come up with a model that helps us to predict
what the women's weight is going to be, dependent on their height?
